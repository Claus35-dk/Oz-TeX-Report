\section{Conclusion}
In this report we follow the development of a web service and a matching client in form of a website. Our report is divided into two parts: Server and Client. Each part describes the process of development for the part at hand.
\\An important part of this project was our collaboration with a Singaporean group of students. An accord of our collaboration can be found in the Server part of this report as our collaboration was in regard to the server and the web services it is hosting.

We were terribly behind on our assignments and we did not have time to write a review of another groups report. \textbf{[ TODO: This needs some work. Quite sudden. (M) ]}
\\\textbf{Claus agrees. Should first part be removed completely?\\Ja - Krüger}

\subsubsubsection{Server}
We created web services written partly in C\Sh, but mostly in F\Sh. We set a number of requirements for our services. Due to the combined load of the shared server we do not meet our requirements for uptime and response time.
\\We meet almost all functional requirements. We lack the following functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item Handling of metadata
\item Deletion of products
\item Acquiring the last authentication time of an account
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Collaboration}
We had a successful collaboration with our Singaporean group. Lynette, Cai Ling and Celestine were as engaged and enthusiastic about the project as we were. We held two weekly meetings and we chatted daily.

\subsubsubsection{Client}
\textbf{[ TODO: The following is an almost exact copy of the Client/Server. What can we do about that? (C) ]}

We wrote our client in object oriented PHP and we wrote our tests in PHPUnit. The client makes use of the web service described in the first part of this report. The client is written by the principles of the MVC design pattern and its modules is interchangeable.

We wanted to write an object oriented client which should be very easy to maintain and that is exactly what we did. A single view creates the web page and fills its content with a widget composite structure.

We did not have the time to fulfill all the requirements and use cases we had set for ourselves. Specifically we did not create a widget for uploading thumbnails and other media. Aside from that our client is fully functional.

\subsubsubsection{Process} 
\textbf{[ TODO: Remove this section? (C) ] \\
I think it should stay (Mo)}
In the first part of the project, we did not use any specific development method - we listed what needed to be done and then we worked it from the top. We often had to work more hours than we thought to keep the deadlines and it put us under a lot of stress.

For the second part of the project we decided to incorporate many SCRUM artifacts and it was of great advantage to us. At this point we were far behind our time schedule, but with help from SCRUM artifacts we could estimate the tasks at hand and thereby exclude less important tasks and we could schedule workdays with enough hours to get the job done.
