\subsubsection{Problem Statement}
We where given the task to produce a media rental web service, from this point on referred to as 'service', to support 3rd party programs to use. The service should be published through IIS, use Microsoft SQL Server database and run on the ITU server rentit.itu.dk.
\\\\
Together with the group from SMU we should determine a set of requirements for the service, and implement these. See section \ref{s_serviceRequirements} for more details.
\\\\
The point of this assignment is not focus on security and other forms for safety. Our main focus should therefore lie on the business requirements for the system, so that we will have a working product at the end.
