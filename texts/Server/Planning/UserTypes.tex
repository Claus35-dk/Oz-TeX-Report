\subsubsection{User types}
\label{s_actor-goal-list}
At the current state of the system, we have implemented four kinds of user type, though more can be added dynamically. This gives an idea of which functionality the server should offer, and to whom (that is which user types) at its current state.

\begin{description}
	\item [Non-registered user] \hfill \\
		This is the user type with the least options. Only allowed to browse the products, and register to become a customer.
	\item [Customer]  \hfill \\
		The costumer are quite possible the most common user type the service will have. The differences between a customer and a non-registered user is that the customer is able to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item buy/rent products
			\item download/view products
			\item rate products
		\end{itemize}
	\item [Content provider] \hfill \\
		The content provider are, as the name suggest, the users who is filling the service with products. They can't rent og buy media, but only upload and manage their own products.
	\item [Admin] \hfill \\
		The admin is the most powerful user type, with the power to administrate registered users, content providers and product information.
