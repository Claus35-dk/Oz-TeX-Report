\subsubsection{Test Strategy}
After we finished the server we changed how we would continue the project.
One of the things we changed was to define a test strategy for the client.
After we designed the structure of the client we agreed upon which parts of the program we would test and which parts were not as important to test.
Since our time was limited we did not write tests for any widget and the tests on the rest were minimum tests, where we tested expected results on normal behavior and error handling of the errors from the server.
We chose to write the tests after the code, which made it easier to write the tests. We chose to use PHPunit as our testing framework.

All of the above was a conscious choice, since we were focusing the remaining time on completing the project.
Instead of writing the tests afterwards we could have made them in advance, which would have required more of us in the design phase, but would have given a clearer idea about how the code should react in certain situations.
