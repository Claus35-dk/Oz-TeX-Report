\section{Introduction}
This paper was written for the second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration at the IT-University of Copenhagen in spring 2013.

The project has been divided into two parts. In the first part we where to developed a web service, while a group from Singapore Management University (from hereon referred to as SMU) was to develop a client using the web service we made. At the second part of the project, we where to develop a client using our web service.

The first part of the project has therefore been very focused on how to collaborate with another group on the other side of the world. A collaboration where both time, culture and language are factors to be kept in mind.

In this paper we will explain our approach to the project and the collaboration in the first part.
The paper is divided into two primary parts, the implementation of the server and the implementation of the client.
The two parts should be able to be read independently, with only few significant references between. We will end each part with a reflection and a conclusion of the work made in this part.
At the end of the paper we will conclude on the entire project.
