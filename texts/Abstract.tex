\section*{Abstract}
This report is about our collaboration with a group of students from the Singapore Management University and our experiences gained from that collaboration. We encountered planning issues due to time difference, cultural differences and language barriers.

Doing our collaboration, we were to produce a web service to be used by both us and the group from Singapore. Based on our use cases and the Singaporean group's use cases, we produced an extensive web service interface. The web service interface was finished and approved with the Singaporean group.
The web service was to be used by a website hosting a media renting site ala Netflix. The Singaporean group wrote their website while we wrote the web service.

We chose to write the web service with a F\Sh backend. This was a new language to us, but it turned out to be an amazing language with many strong features and we do not regret our choice.
At our agreed upon deadline our code was lacking proper testing, and we had some long evenings, correcting our errors as the Singaporeans checked them in.

The final server ended up being very fast. A lot faster than we anticipated. It did lack some essential features though. This made some of the features of our client harder to implement.

After two months our collaboration with the Singaporean group came to an end and it was time for us to write our own client. We chose to write it in Object Oriented PHP. Some of us had previous experience with this language, and we all wanted to try it out. We planned our client thoroughly and ended up using a lot of clever patterns. The final system is very extendable and maintainable.

Our client ended up being quite good, even though we did not meet all our requirements. We had very little time left at the end of the project, and some functionality had to be cut.
