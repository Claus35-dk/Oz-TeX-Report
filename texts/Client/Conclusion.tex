\subsection{Conclusion}

\textbf{[ TODO: CLAUS rewrite this (M) ]}


In this section of the report we walked through the development of the client and everything that includes: Planning, setting requirements, creating use cases and defining the program structure. Then we look back and review our requirements coverage, bug list and backlog, before we reflect upon the hole process.

We wrote our client in object oriented PHP and we wrote our tests in PHPUnit. The client makes use of the web service described in the first part of this report.

We wanted to write an object oriented client which should be very easy to maintain and that is exactly what we did. A single view creates the web page and fills its content with a widget composite structure.

We did not have the time to fulfill all the requirements and use cases we had set for ourselves. Specifically we did not create a widget for uploading thumbnails and other media. Aside from that our client is functional and very usable:
% Be aware: The following list is copied to the report Conclusion. Any changes should be synchronized.
\begin{itemize}
\item Create, view and edit accounts
\item Create, view and edit products
\item Buy credits (though they are free for now)
\item View and stream purchases
\item Buy, rent and rate products
\item Administrators can edit everything and create content provider and administrator accounts
\end{itemize}

\#\#\# Add the lack of ban/unban if the functionality is not added \#\#\#
