\subsection{Conclusion}
In this section of the report we have walked through the development of our server, beginning at our planning iteration, with use cases and data modeling, to a program structure walk-through, and on to the important quality assurance chapter, which includes fulfilling requirements, testing and a list of bugs, before we end up discussing our collaboration with SMU.

In the Requirements section, we list three none-functional requirements. Due to the combined load of the shared server our uptime and response time requirements have not always been met.

We meet almost all requirements. The lacking functionality is listed in our To do list:
% Be aware: The Todo is copied from the Server\Quality chapter. Any changes should be synchronized.
\begin{itemize}
\item Handling metadata not implemented in the C\Sh outer layer
\item Somehow support deletion of products without robbing the customer of his purchase
\item Throw correct error code when creating an account that already exists
\item Correct product rating calculations
\end{itemize}
