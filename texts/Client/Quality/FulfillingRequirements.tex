\subsubsection{Fulfilling Requirements}
Regarding the functional requirements, found in\pref{s_serviceRequirements}, we did not fulfill all of the requirements. This was mainly due to the fact that we did not have enough time at the end of the process and therefore chose to cut of some the functionality and focus on this paper.

\textbf{[ TODO: List the requirements we did not meet. ]}
