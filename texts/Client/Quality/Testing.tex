\subsubsection{Testing}
We decided to write PHPUnit test for the controllers and models, while testing of the views would be done by using blackbox testing. We tested normal behavior and the exception handling of the exception thrown by the server. This ensured that we had a much better idea of where any problem arose during debugging. Error messaging in PHP is known for being very limited. By having a good idea of how the individual parts behaved we saved time on the debugging, since we did not have to go through all the code involved in-depth to solve the problem. 

Since much of what was tested of the widgets focused on the design, this was done using blackbox testing as we saw it as the only way to do it.
