\subsubsection{Known Bugs}
From the first release of our server we have held a list of known bugs and a list of things yet not implemented. These were kept assure throughout the development process.
\\Here are the lists showing the current shortages of our server:
\paragraph{Bug list}
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding metadata to products does not work.
\item Description string for products cannot pass more than 80 characters.
\item Deleting products not implemented.
\end{itemize}
The problem with the length of the description string, is a problem with our JSON serializer and should not take long to correct.
\paragraph{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Handling metadata not implemented in the C\Sh outer layer
\item Somehow support deletion of products without robbing the customer of his purchase
\item Get a single Puchase ID, by user and product
\item Throw correct error code when creating an account that already exists
\item Correct product rating calculations
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Improvements}
While writing our client we discovered a number of things our server does not support which would have made it easier to write the client. There are also a couple of things we simply did not prioritize when we wrote the server.
\begin{itemize}
\item Encryption and security in general
\item Simple web service methods such as a more specified method to get one or a few products.
\item A method for getting unpublished products for the Content Providers Dashboard
\end{itemize}
