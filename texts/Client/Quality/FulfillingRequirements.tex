\subsubsection{Fulfilling Requirements}
We did not fulfill all of the requirements (found in \pref{s_serviceRequirements}). This was mainly due to the fact that we did not have enough time and therefore chose to cut some of the functionality and focus on this paper.

The following functionality described by our functional requirements are not supported by the client:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Upload thumbnail widget
	\item Upload media
	\item List all products (only partially supported, search is not implemented)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{[ TODO: List the requirements we did not meet. ]}
