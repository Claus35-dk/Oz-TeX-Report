\subsection{Conclusion}
We wrote our client in object oriented PHP and our tests using PHPUnit. The client makes use of the web services described in the first part of this report.

We wanted to write an object oriented client which should be very easy to maintain and that is exactly what we did. A single view creates the web page and fills its content with a widget composite structure.

We did not have the time to fulfill all the requirements and use cases we had set for ourselves. Specifically we did not create a widget for uploading thumbnails and other media. Aside from that our client is functional and very usable. The following functionality is working as intended:
