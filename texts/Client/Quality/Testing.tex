\subsubsection{Testing}
We decided to write PHPUnit test for the controllers and models, while testing of the views would be done by running the code. We tested normal behavior and the exception handling of the exception thrown by the server. This ensured that we had a much better idea of where any problem that arose during debugging. Error messaging in PHP is known for being very limited. By having a good idea of how the individual parts behaved we saved time on the debugging, since we did not have to go through all the code involved in-depth to solve the problem. 

Testing of the widgets were blackbox testing, by running the code, this part of the code could not be tested by writing unit test, since much of what was tested was design.
