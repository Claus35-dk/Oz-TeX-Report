\section{Introduction}
This paper was written for the `Second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration' \textbf{course (Claus)} at the IT-University of Copenhagen during the spring 2013.

The project was divided into two parts. In the first part we were to develop web services while a group from the Singapore Management University (from here on referred to as SMU) simultaneously were to develop a client consuming the web services.
The focus of the first part of the project was upon long-distance collaboration, with both time, culture and language being important factors to be kept in mind.
In the second part of the project we were to develop a client for our own web services.

This paper is divided into two primary parts, 1) the implementation of the server including the associated collaboration process and 2) the implementation of the client.

The two parts can be read independently, with only few insignificant references between them. To support this independence we will end each part with a reflection and a conclusion of the work made in the respective part.
At the end of the paper we will conclude on the entire project.
