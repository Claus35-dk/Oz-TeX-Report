\subsubsection{Testing}
We chose to divide the development of the server into two parts, the part responsible for account actions and the part responsible for product actions. \todo{Did we?}{Michael} During the development of the account part of the server testing was primarily done by running the code, when it became possible. The testing of the account module and controlled account module \todo{Only those two?}{Michael} was done by using the tool Fiddler2. This form of testing proved incredibly inefficient since we had no real idea of what kind of errors and exceptions the individual parts of the server threw and we could not test individual parts of the server to see if they independently responded correctly.

The second part of the development tests were written using FsUnit. This includes testing of the product module, the credits module most of the account module. The tests mainly tested within the normal responses expected of the code and in some cases for some of the exceptions they throw. Since the debugging was mostly done by the time all of the tests were done it was primarily used to prove that the code performed as expected.

We have a total of 133 unit tests that all pass.
