\subsubsection{Use Cases}
In the following section we will present the use case diagram and the use cases made to uncover the functional requirements for the system.

\subsubsubsection{Use case diagram}
We have produced a use case diagram, see Figure \ref{useCaseImg} p. \pageref{useCaseImg}, which outlines the boundaries of the system, and how the different actors (user types) can interact with the server.

\textit{Only two use cases will be listed here. For a complete list of our use cases, see\apref{Apendix_usecases}}
