\subsubsection{Known Bugs}
Our web client has been in development till the end of this project. Now that we are at our deadline it is time to summarize the remaining items on our bug list and todo list:

\subsubsubsection{Bug list}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{[ TODO: Nothing? (C) ]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ban/unban accounts functionality for administrators
\item Upload widget for upload of thumbnails and media
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Improvements}
We are very happy with our client and its structure. It is extremely flexible and functionality can easily be added. We do not wish to refactor anything structural about the client at this time.

The performance of our client is very good. Our web service lacks methods for getting a more specific subset of products. Some times we have to request more products than we need and then filter them on the client which can impact the performance of the site.

There are a few things which are out of scope for this project that one would add to our client before setting the client online for the public. Those things would be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encryption and general security
\item Payment for credits
\item Commercials
\end{itemize}
\textbf{[ TODO: More? (C) ]}
