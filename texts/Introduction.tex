\section{Introduction}
This paper was written for the `Second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration' at the IT-University of Copenhagen during the spring 2013.

The project was divided into two parts. In the first part we were to develop a web service while a group from the Singapore Management University (from here on referred to as SMU) were to develop a client using the web service we made. In the second part of the project we were to develop a client using our web service.

The first part of the project focused on long-distance collaboration, with both time, culture and language being important factors to be kept in mind.

In this paper we will document our approach to the project and the collaboration in the first part.\\
The paper is divided into two primary parts, the implementation of the server and the implementation of the client.
The two parts should be able to be read independently, with only few significant references between. We will end each part with a reflection and a conclusion of the work made in the respective part.
At the end of the paper we will conclude on the entire project.
