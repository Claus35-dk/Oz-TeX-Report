\section{Target audience}
We have tried to make our backend server and data model as flexible and capable as possible, because we wanted it to work with whatever audience one might choose to target with one's client. It was time consuming, but we did not want our service to impose any restrictions on the clients, which was helpful since we did not fully know what sort of site SMU had in mind.

For our client we wanted to implement something like Netflix, but without the limitations of only video content. 
We view our target content providers as companies who cheaply wants to make content available for the masses with the freedom to select a pricing model themselves.
To make our client attractive for content providers we set out to support both free products, paid products, as well as products for rent.

We see our client customers as familiar with the Internet. We want our client to be easy to use by customers of any age. A kids version would be nice to have, but it is not something we will look into at this time.

Our very wide choice of target audience might prove not to be lucrative. Netflix is a very specific service and people know exactly what they can get from that service. Our wide array of services does not limit us per see, making it harder to promote. Being a wide array of services, we might also find it harder to provide specialized functionality to win over customers.
