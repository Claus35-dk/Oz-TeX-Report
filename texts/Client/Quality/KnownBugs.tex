\subsubsection{Known Bugs}
Our web client has been in development till the end of this project. Now that we are at our deadline it is time to summarize the remaining items on our bug list and todo list:

\subsubsubsection{Bug list}
\begin{itemize}
\item No known bugs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Upload widget for upload of thumbnails and media.
\item Search.
\item Implement metadata functionalist (awaits server support)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Improvements}
We are very happy with our client and its structure. It is extremely flexible and functionality can easily be added. We do not wish to refactor anything structural about the client at this time.

The performance of our client is generally very good. Our web service however lacks methods for getting a more specific subset of products, which means we some times have to request more products than we need and then filter them on the client, which impacts the performance of the site. This is evident on the pages listing multiple products.

There are a few things which are out of scope for this project that one would add to our client before making the client available for the public. Those things would be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Encryption and general security
\item Better error messages
\item Payment for credits
\item Commercials
\item Prettier styling
\end{itemize}
