\subsubsection{Requirements}
For the client we had the same functional requirements as we had for the web service, see \pref{s_serviceRequirements}.

Regarding non-functional requirements we only settled for a single requirement: From the time a request has been received to the time a response has been sent, no more than 1000 millisecond must have passed, except for product file requests, in which case the transfer only is required to have started within this time.
