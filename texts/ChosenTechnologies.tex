\section{Chosen technologies}
In the very beginning, even before our collaboration with SMU we decided upon which technologies we would like to use. Later, we had the parts concerning SMU approved by them.

We chose to use F\Sh for developing our server. We had all recently been introduced to the programming language and were very exited about it and the completely different ideas on which it is based. We all attended a course in the language, but wanted to use it in a bigger project in order to put it into perspective, and so we unanimously decided it as the language of choice for our server, which was approved by our lecturer.

For SMU to be able to use our server we had to expose the functionality as a web service. Two different technologies were at hand, namely SOAP and REST. We chose to use REST because it is much simpler than using SOAP, and thereby less time consuming to use in the client.

We faced some difficulties in exposing web services as we chose to use F\Sh for programming. We learned that web services in F\Sh was not at a state that was easy for us to use, and therefore we planned to implement a thin service-layer in C\Sh. This should then call the corresponding parts of our F\Sh code. This, however, turned out not to be so thin as we planned.

For storing data we all agreed to use the SQL format. We all used this before with great success and wanted to keep using it. After this choice was made we had to choose between two different implementations. MySQL and MSSQL. We started out by agreeing on using MySQL, as we all had worked with it before, and favored it to MSSQL. We also talked to our lecturer about this and he was indifferent about it. However, when we started making our data model, and deployed it on the server it became apparent that it was easier to use MSSQL, as we did not need to setup server in any way.

Lastly we decided on which technology we wanted to write our own client in. We did not want to program our client in ASP, or any of the other Microsoft web languages. Some of us has \textbf{[TODO: remove 'has'?]} had some experience with PHP, and one in the group had extensive experience with it. We decided that we wanted to try programming our client in PHP. We asked our lecturer, and it was approved.
