\subsection{Conclusion}
Through this section of the report we have walked through the development of our server, beginning at our planning iteration, with use cases and data modeling, to a program structure walk-through, and on to the important quality assurance chapter, which includes fulfilling requirements, testing and a list of bugs, before we end up talking about our collaboration with SMU.

In the Requirements section, we list three none-functional requirements. Do to the combined load of the shared project server our uptime and response time requirements have not always been met.

We also list 18 functional requirements which we set with our SMU group. Our server live up to all of these and more.
