\section{Problem statement}
A project description was given to us at the start of the course describing the project and the deploying environment given by the ITU.

The web server we where to make should be published trough ISS on a ITU server and make use of a Microsoft SQL Server database.
We where to negotiate the requirements for the server together with the SMU, whom was to develop a client using our web service as backend.
Our web service should be created in such a way that (hypothetical) another group would be able to use the service

After the end of the collaboration with SMU we where to develop our own client, either using the web service made in the previous part or using another web service of our own choice.
There was no limitations on which technologies was to be used to develop this client, only that our Course manager, The great and powerful Niels Hallenberg, should approve the chosen technology.
