\subsubsection{Test Strategy}
CLIENT
After we finished the server we changed a lot in how we would continue the project and one of these things were a test strategy for the client. After we designed the client's structure we agreed on which parts of the program we had to test and which parts where not as important to test. Since we had very limited time we did not write test classes for any views and the tests on the rest were minimum tests, where we tested expected results on normal behavior and on error handling of the server's errors. We chose to write the tests after the code, which made it easier to write the tests. We chose to use PHPunit.

This was a conscious choice, since we were focusing the remaining time on completing the project. Instead of writing the tests afterwards we could have made them in advance, which would have required more in the design phase, but would have given a clearer idea of how the code should react in certain situations.
