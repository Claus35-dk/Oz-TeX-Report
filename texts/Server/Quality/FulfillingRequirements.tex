\subsubsection{Fulfilling Requirements}
\label{serverfulfil}
This section briefly summarizes our fulfillment of our requirements, and in cases where we did not, explain why that is so.

Due to the fact that the web services are currently deployed on a server at ITU which also hosts the web services of all other groups, we have no real control over the server. The server seems to be heavily overloaded, and therefore our requirements concerning uptime and response time can not be met at all time.

Our requirement of persisting all data for a 5 year time period is also out of our reach, again due to the fact that we are only `guests' at the ITU server.

Regarding the functional requirements we have set, we fulfill most of the them even though the part concerning the products does not make use of the permissions layer. The permissions layer concerning the credits are also somewhat questionable.

Some other functional requirements are also missing, these are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Handling of product meta data
\item Deletion of products
\item Event and error logging not implemented
\end{itemize}
