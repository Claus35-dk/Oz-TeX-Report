\section{Project description}
A project description was given to us at the start of the course describing the project and the deploying environment given by the ITU.

The web server we were to make should be published trough IIS on a ITU server and make use of a Microsoft SQL Server database.
We were to negotiate the requirements of the server with the SMU, whom was to develop a client using our web services as backend.
The web service should be created in such a way that another group  (hypothetically) would be able to use the service.

After the end of the collaboration with SMU we were to develop our own client, either using the web services made in the previous part or using other web services of our own choice. \textbf{[ TODO: <-- Really? (M) ]}
There was no limitations on which technologies we were to use to develop the client, only that our course manager had to approve it.
