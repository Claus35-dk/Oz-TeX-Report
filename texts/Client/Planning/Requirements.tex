\subsubsection{Requirements}
For the client we mainly had the same functional requirements as we had for the web service, see section \ref{s_serviceRequirements}, page \pageref{s_serviceRequirements}.

We did have some non-functional requirements though, which mainly were maintenance related. We wanted to make a structure for the client that made i easy to reuse and create new content holders and other useful code blocks.
