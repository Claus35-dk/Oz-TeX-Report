\subsubsection{Requirements}
For the client we had the same functional requirements as we had for the web service, see\pref{s_serviceRequirements}.

Regarding non-functional requirements we only specify a single requirement: From the time a request has been received to the time a response has been sent, no more than 1000 millisecond must have passed, except for product file requests, in which case the transfer is required to have started within this time.
