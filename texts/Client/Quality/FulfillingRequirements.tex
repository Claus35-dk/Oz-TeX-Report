\subsubsection{Fulfilling Requirements}
We did manage to make a structure in our client code that made exhaustive reuse of code, our so called widgets.

Regarding the non-functional requirements, found in section \ref{s_serviceRequirements} page \pageref{s_serviceRequirements}, we did not fulfil all of the requirements. This was mainly due to the fact that we did not have enough time at the end of the process and therefore choose to cut of some the functionality and focus on the report.
