\subsubsubsection{User types}
\label{s_actor-goal-list}
We use four user types in our system. Below we give an overview of the functionality the server should provide to each dynamically defined user type that we have chosen for this version of the server. 

\begin{description}
	\item [Non-registered user] \hfill \\
		This is the user type with the least options, only being able to browse the products and register to become a customer.
	\item [Customer]  \hfill \\
		The customer is quite possibly the most common user type the service will have. The big difference between a customer and a non-registered user is the customer's ability to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item buy/rent products
			\item buy credits
			\item download/view products
			\item rate products
		\end{itemize}
	\item [Content provider] \hfill \\
		The content provider is, as the name suggest, the kind of user who will be filling the service with products. They cannot rent, buy, or rate products, only upload and manage their own products
	\item [Admin] \hfill \\
		The admin is the most powerful user type with the power to administrate any registered user or product, including changing any piece of associated information.
