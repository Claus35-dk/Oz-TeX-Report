\section{Conclusion}
In this report we develop a number of web services and a matching client in form of a website. We wrote the server in F\Sh with a web service layer written in C\Sh. We wrote the client in PHP.

We set many requirements for our system and neither part fulfilled all of them due to lack of time.

We fulfill by far the majority of the requirements and we have shown that we can develop a web service and a matching client.

\subsubsubsection{Collaboration}
We had a successful collaboration with a Singaporean group. Lynette, Cai Ling and Celestine were as engaged and enthusiastic about the project as we were. We held two weekly meetings and we chatted daily.

\subsubsubsection{Process} 
In the first part of the project, we did not use any specific development method - we listed what needed to be done and then we worked it from the top. We often had to work more hours than we thought to keep the deadlines and it put us under a lot of stress.

For the second part of the project we decided to incorporate many SCRUM artifacts and it was of great advantage to us. At this point we were far behind our time schedule, but with help from SCRUM artifacts we could estimate the tasks at hand and thereby exclude less important tasks and we could schedule workdays with enough hours to get the job done.

\mbox{}\newline
We were terribly behind on our assignments and we did not have time to write a review of another groups report.
