\subsubsection{Fulfilling Requirements}
\label{serverfulfil}
The following section will briefly summarize our fulfillment of our requirements, and in cases where we did not, explain why that is so.

Due to the fact that the web services are currently deployed on a server at ITU, together with the web services of all other groups, we have no real control over the server. The server seems to be heavily overloaded, and therefore our requirements concerning uptime and response time can not be met at all time.

Our requirement of persisting all data for a 5 year time period is also out of our reach, again due to the fact that we are only "guests" at the ITU server.

Regarding the functional requirements we have set up, we fulfill the requirements even though some user types have permissions to do more than the list expresses.
