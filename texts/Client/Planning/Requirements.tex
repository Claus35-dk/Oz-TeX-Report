\subsubsection{Requirements}
For the client we did mainly have the same functional requirements as we had for the web service, see section \ref{s_serviceRequirements}, page \pageref{s_serviceRequirements}.

We did have some non-functional requirements thou, which mainly where maintenance related. We wanted to make a structure for the client that made i easy to reuse and create new content holders and other useful code blocks.
We did not go into detail on how to measure the accomplishment of this requirement, but thought that we all know pretty much how it should be.
