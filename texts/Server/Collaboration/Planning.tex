\subsubsection{Planning and Meetings}
At our first meeting with our SMU group we decided to video chat every Tuesday and Thursday. We started each meeting by summarizing the previous just to make sure that nothing had been misunderstood. Then we informed the other group of the progress we had made, any obstacles we might have encountered and any matters that acquired the other groups opinion and/or confirmation. 

We held almost every planned meeting. The meetings were most important in the beginning where we were planning and negotiating. By the end of our collaboration we chose to cancel a few meetings since neither group had any news to report.

At our first meeting we also started a very rough schedule which we since used to set deadlines. Our SMU group found it very useful to be able to see what we were working on and what had been finished.
Our schedules can be viewed in \apref{schedule}
