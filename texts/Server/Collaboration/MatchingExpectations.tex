\subsubsection{Matching Expectations}
We were very anxious to find out how dedicated and how much time our SMU group had for us and the project. It was very important for us to know. We were willing to lay a lot of hours into this interesting and rare opportunity to work in collaboration with a group of students from across the world, but only if they cared and were willing as well.

At our first meeting we set some expectations to each other. We were unsure about the affect the time difference would have on the response time. Without discussion we agreed upon a maximum of two days response time and 15 minutes of leeway upon agreed meeting times. Two days of response time is a very long time, and we voiced that we would not exceed 24 hours response time - they did not expect to do so either.

We were very happy with our SMU group and they did not break our contract. They exceeded our expectations in regard to the number of hours they put into the project and especially in regard to their initiative which was overwhelming.

We told our SMU group that we would like to be using REST ourselves (opposed to SOAP), but that we would offer SOAP as well if they preferred. They agreed to use REST without any questions.
