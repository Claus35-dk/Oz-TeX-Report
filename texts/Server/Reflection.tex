\subsection{Reflection (Server)}
Due to previous experiences we spend a lot of time on careful planning. Even then there are a lot of things we would do differently, were we given the chance again.

We are very happy with our very flexible design of layers and modules, but of course we want to make it even better and even less coupled next time. A major mistake of ours is the lack of design patterns throughout our server. When we review our code and debug our code, it proves to be less decoupled than we intended. 

We intended to create a logging feature where every module could report events and errors, but we never had the time. Writing the log might have saved us time. When debugging it was not always apparent which module failed or which module received faulty information. 

When writing the client, we encountered a surprising lack of functionality from our server - exactly what we had tried hard to avoid. Not before writing the client, could we have predicted which services we would acquire. Unfortunately we were in a terrible lack of time and we kept our focus on the client.

\subsection{Reflection (SMU Collaboration)}
We were excited about the project and we really hoped to get a group who were as engaged and enthusiastic about the project as we were - and luckily we did.

Our collaboration with our lovely Singaporean group went very well - beyond all expectations really. We get the impression that they also enjoyed working with us. We have held many meetings and we chatted every day.
